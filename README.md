# Hough_Transform
- Project for Satellite Image Processing(SIP) by Ashutosh Mitra(203310012) and Laylo Kamoliddinovna Zaridinova(203311003)

- Our problem statement : Implement Hough transform for line detection using both equations for line
                            y=mx+c, 
                            xcos(theta) + ysin(theta) = rho
			
- Files contained in the zip file:
  1.) .py(python) file for the code of our project
  2.) GUI screenshot
  3.) Input image
  4.) screenshot of the Outputs
  5.) Powerpoint presentation slides 
  .6) This readme 

BONUS - We also made a Graphical User Interface(GUI) using the tkinter module of python which has all functonalities
       integrated in it to run the code and get the output for both m-c space and Rho-theta space and to exit the GUI.
